    "simple_explanation": "Saving money means keeping some of your money aside instead of spending it all. Imagine you get some pocket money and you don’t use all of it for toys or snacks. You keep a part of it in a piggy bank for later. That saved money helps you when you want something bigger or when you really need money in the future.",
    "normal_explanation": "Saving money means setting aside a portion of your income instead of spending everything immediately. People save money to handle future needs, emergencies, or planned goals. Saving creates financial security and reduces stress during unexpected situations.

    "topic": "Why saving money is important",

But if you think before spending and avoid unnecessary purchases, you can save more money. Good spending habits help your savings grow over time.",
    "normal_explanation": "Spending habits directly influence how much money a person is able to save. Frequent unnecessary spending, impulse buying, or ignoring expenses can reduce savings.

    "normal_explanation": "Compounding frequency refers to how frequently interest is calculated and added to the principal amount. Common frequencies include yearly, quarterly, monthly, or daily.

    "normal_explanation": "SIP works by investing a fixed amount periodically into a mutual fund. Units are purchased at prevailing prices, leading to cost averaging over time. This approach reduces market timing risk and encourages disciplined long-term investing.",
